# Population coverage estimates for facility catchment areas (all facilities)

**Status**: `Active`

**Last updated**:
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y'))
``` 


## Data
* DHIS2 data extracted in May 2024 for all facilities reporting contraceptive method stock outs from October - December 2023.
* Radio station rasters generated by CloudRF and coverted to a dissolved polygon GeoPackage (done in QGIS)

## Scripts
- `dbscan.R`: Script to create clusters of facilities that are within x-km of each other and estimate the population covered by each cluster.
-   `radio_populations.R`: Script to select facility catchment areas within radio bounds and compute the proportion of the radio bound population \# that each DBSCAN facility cluster covers.
-   `population_summary.R`: Script to summarise for each radio estimate.
    -   what the total population proportion would be if all clusters were included (ie. if all facilities were stocked).
    -   how many clusters are there (ie. how many facility groups would need to be stocked)?
    -   how many facilities are there (ie. how many facilities, at most, would need to be stocked)?
- `stock_all_facilities.R`: Essentially the radio_populations.R script but for dissolved buffers of all facilities.
- `analyse_selected_facilities.R`: Estimates the number of replacement facilities and marginal population coverage of each point that is not sufficiently stocked.


## Roadmap

General improvements:
1. Improve linting
2. Improve generalisability of scripts
3. Add ability to create directories if they do not exist
